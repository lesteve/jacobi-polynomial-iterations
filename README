Guide for the code generating the figures of Berthier, Bach, Gaillard - Accelerated Gossip in Networks of Given Dimension using Jacobi Polynomial Iterations.


build_all_figures.py runs all scripts to produce all of the figures of the paper (related to the simulations). This will take a few minutes.
polynomial_gossip.py contains auxiliary functions that are used in the files below.
grid.py generates Figures 2A, 2B, 3, 4.
percolation.py generates  Figures 2C, 2D. 
random_geometric_graph.py generates Figures 2D, 2F.
comparison_polynomials.py generates Figure 5.
message_passing.py generates Figures 6, 7.
parameter_tuning.py generates Figures 8, 9.
